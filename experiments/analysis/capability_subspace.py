"""Build per-layer capability subspaces from cascade stage task vectors.

Implements the basis construction that DACSP (CARE-RL) applies before gating
optimizer updates, and that Modular Gradient Surgery needs to identify conflict
modules. Both require stage boundaries, which is why the cascade line exists.

Pipeline, per parameter tensor:

  1. Task vector for stage d:  Delta_d = theta_d - theta_{d-1}
  2. Thin SVD of the reshaped 2-D matrix, keep the fewest leading components
     reaching ``energy`` (0.95 in the paper). Each retained pair (u_i, v_i)
     defines a rank-one direction B_i = u_i v_i^T.
  3. Vectorise every direction from all prior stages, concatenate, and run a
     rank-revealing QR. Drop columns whose R diagonal falls under tolerance.
  4. QR can flip signs, so re-orient each basis vector against its pivoted
     source direction; otherwise "aligned" and "opposing" lose their meaning,
     which is the whole point of the alpha+/alpha- split.

The paper's checkpoint-surgery control matters for interpretation: the top
subspace alone retained 91.0% of a single-domain gain while an equal-rank random
subspace retained 4.9%. Any use of this basis should carry that control.
